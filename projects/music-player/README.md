# Music player

This music player will play songs using 1 to 24 passive buzzers, as well as show their title on an LCD display. Several parameters can be changed for each individual song, such as song title, tempo, loudness, etc.

This project also contains a script that will automatically turn the notes from the website https://pianoletternotes.blogspot.com into an array that the python program can be used. Instructions on how to use that js file are inside of the child directory.

Image on how to wire everything will be available at some point in the near future.
