# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-W

* The basic folder contains files on how to control individual sensors/compnents
* The lib folder contains librairies that are required to make certain sensors work
* The projects folder will contain major projects

I would like to point out that I am a beginner with micro controllers, so please don't judge my code/wiring. I am truly doing my best.
